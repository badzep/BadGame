# Bad Game
I'm just making this for fun, and the finished game (assuming I actually finish it) will probably suck since this is my first game.

Since this is still in the testing phase, the code sucks and I have no clue what the gameplay or mechanics will even look like. 

The visual style is heavily inspired by [Crypt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138700/Crypt/), which was made by [Valefisk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD03ljcM434&t=606s).

Uses [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for 3d rendering and [ODE](https://github.com/thomasmarsh/ODE) for physics.
